# Vite-Express-Template

**Vite-Express-Template** combines **Vite** for fast front-end development with **Express** for back-end API handling. It offers a full-stack setup, where **Vite** handles the development workflow with hot-reloading, while **Express** serves API routes and static files, providing a seamless development experience.

The template also includes automated **testing** with:

-   **Jest** and **Supertest** for back-end API route testing.
-   **Jest** and **React Testing Library** for front-end component testing.

This ensures a robust, reliable, and efficient development process.
